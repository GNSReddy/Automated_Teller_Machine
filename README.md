# Automated_Teller_Machine
This project is a simple ATM Simulation System developed using Python, mainly intended for beginners who are learning programming fundamentals. The goal of this project is to understand how real-world systems like an ATM work by implementing their logic using basic Python concepts and slowly updating this project.
